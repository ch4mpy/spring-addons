7.0.0 is a break through in usability: all 6 `spring-addons` Boot starters are merged into a single one: [`com.c4-soft.springaddons:spring-addons-starter-oidc`](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/c4-soft/springaddons/spring-addons-starter-oidc/), and so are 4 of the test libs: [`com.c4-soft.springaddons:spring-addons-starter-oidc-test`](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/c4-soft/springaddons/spring-addons-starter-oidc-test/). To use the test annotations without the starter, the dependency id unchanged: [`com.c4-soft.springaddons:spring-addons-oauth2-test`](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/c4-soft/springaddons/spring-addons-oauth2-test/).

Please follow the [migration guide](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/blob/master/7.0.0-migration-guide.md) to move from `6.x` to `7.0.6`. There is no urge to do so on existing projects as 6.2.x patches should be published untill the end of 2023.

All samples and tutorials sources are migrated to latest starter and test annotations, but some READMEs might still need a refresh. Please make sure you refer to source code for up to date configuration.

# Configuring and Testing OAuth2 / OpenID in Spring Applications Made Easy
The libraries hosted in this repo shine in two domains:
- providing with annotations to mock OAuth2 `Authentication` for JUnit `@Test` and `@ParameterizedTest`:
  * `@WithMockAuthentication` with `@AuthenticationSource` and `@ParameterizedAuthentication`
  * `@WithJwt` which uses the JWT authentication converter defined in security configuration to build the right type of `Authentication` (with the right authorities and name) based on a JSON file on he classpath (or plain Java String
  * `@WithOpaqueToken` same as `@WithJwt` for introspection, using the `OpaqueTokenAuthenticationConverter` in the security configuration
  * more specialized annotations for specific authentication implementations (`@WithOAuth2Login`, `@WithOidcLogin`, etc.) or to use as elements for your own test annotations in applications using custom OAuth2 `Authentication` implementations
- pushing OIDC auto-configuration to the next level in Spring Boot 3 applications. As shown in **[Tutorials](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/samples/tutorials)**, with 0 Java conf (just properties), we can configure:
  * authorities mapping (source claims, prefix and case transformation), without having to provide authentication converter, user service or `GrantedAuthoritiesMapper` in each app
  * fine grained CORS configuration (per path matcher), which enables to override allowed origins as environment variable when switching from `localhost` to `dev` or `prod` environments
  * sessions & CSRF disabled by default on resource server and enabled on clients. If a cookie repo is chosen for CSRF (as required by Angular, React, Vue, etc.), then the right request handler is configured and a filter to actually set the cookie is added
  * basic access control: `permitAll` for a list of path matchers and `authenticated` as default (to be fine tuned with method security or a configuration post-processor bean)
  * for clients only:
    - logout success handler for OPs not strictly following the standard (exotic parameter names or missing `end_session_endpoint` in OpenID configuration). Auth0 and Amazon Cognito are samples of such OPs.
    - an experimental implementation for client side of the Back-Channel Logout
    - client host and port explicitly provided in login configuration to avoid [redirection issues when the client does not use 8080 (or 8443 if SSL is enabled)](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/12307)
    - add custom params to authorization-code request (like the `audience` required by Auth0). This parameters are defined in application properties for each client registration.

## 1. <a name="oidc-starter"/>Spring Boot Starter
**This starters is designed to push auto-configuration to the next level** and does nothing more than helping you with auto-configuration from application properties.

`spring-addons-oidc-starter` does not replace `spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server` and `spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client`, it uses application properties to configure a few beans designed to be picked by Spring Boot official "starters". The aim is to reduce Java code and ease application deployment across environments. In most cases, you should need 0 Java conf. An effort was made to make [tutorials](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/samples/tutorials), Javadoc as informative as possible. Please refer there for more details.

If you are curious enough, you might inspect what is auto-configured (and under which conditions) by reading the source code, starting from the [org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/blob/master/spring-addons-starter-oidc/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports) file, which is the Spring Boot standard entry-point defining what is loaded when a jar is on the classpath.

You can refer to [module, dependency, class and other diagrams](https://sourcespy.com/github/ch4mpyspringaddons/) for a general overview of the repository.

### 1.1. Usage
**If you are not absolutely sure why you need an OAuth2 client or an OAuth2 resource server configuration (and what are the differences between the two), please read the [OAuth2 essentials section](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/samples/tutorials#1-oauth2-essentials) of the tutorials.** This might save you a lot of time and effort.

Add `com.c4-soft.springaddons:spring-addons-starter-oidc` to your dependencies, in addition to `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client` or `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server`.

If configuring an Outh2 client (with `oauth2Login`), define the standard Spring Boot `provider` and `registration` properties for OAuth2 clients.

If configuring an OAuth2 resource server with access token introspection, define the standard Spring Boot `opaquetoken` properties.

Then, define the relevant `com.c4-soft.springaddons.oidc` properties for your use case. There are many complete [samples](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/samples) and [tutorials](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/samples/tutorials) you should refer to, but here are a few demos for different use-cases and OpenID Providers:

#### 1.1.1. Resource Server with JWT decoder
For a REST API secured with JWT access tokens, you need:
```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<!-- For a reactive application, use spring-boot-starter-webflux instead -->
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
	<groupId>com.c4-soft.springaddons</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-addons-starter-oidc</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
And
```yaml
com:
  c4-soft:
    springaddons:
      oidc:
        ops:
        - iss: http://localhost:8442/realms/master
          username-claim: preferred_username
          authorities:
          - path: $.realm_access.roles
          - path: $.resource_access.*.roles
        resourceserver:
          permit-all:
          - "/greet/public"
          cors:
          - path: /**
            allowed-origin-patterns: http://localhost:4200
```
Above configuration will create an application without sessions nor CSRF protection, and 401 will be answered to unauthorized requests to protected resources.

#### 1.1.2. Client
For an app serving Thymeleaf templates with login and logout:
```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<!-- For a reactive application, use spring-boot-starter-webflux instead -->
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
	<groupId>com.c4-soft.springaddons</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-addons-starter-oidc</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
And
```yaml
cognito-issuer: https://cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/us-west-2_RzhmgLwjl
cognito-client-id: change-me
cognito-secret: change-me

spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          cognito:
            issuer-uri: ${cognito-issuer}
        registration:
          cognito-authorization-code:
            authorization-grant-type: authorization_code
            client-id: ${cognito-client-id}
            client-secret: ${cognito-secret}
            provider: cognito
            scope: openid,profile,email,offline_access
com:
  c4-soft:
    springaddons:
      oidc:
        ops:
        - iss: ${cognito-issuer}
          username-claim: username
          authorities:
          - path: cognito:groups
        client:
          security-matchers:
          - /**
          permit-all:
          - /login/**
          - /oauth2/**
          - /
          # Auth0 and Cognito do not follow strictly the OpenID RP-Initiated Logout spec and need specific configuration
          oauth2-logout:
            cognito-authorization-code:
              uri: https://spring-addons.auth.us-west-2.amazoncognito.com/logout
              client-id-request-param: client_id
              post-logout-uri-request-param: logout_uri
```
Above configuration will create an application secured with sessions (not access tokens), with CSRF protection enabled, and unauthorized requests to protected resources will be redirected to login.

#### 1.1.3. Client and Resource Server
For an app exposing publicly both
- Thymeleaf templates secured with session (with login and logout), all templates being served with `/ui` prefix (but index which is at `/`)
- a REST API secured with access token
```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<!-- In a reactive application, use only spring-boot-starter-webflux -->
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<!-- Used for WebClient to call the REST API from controllers serving Thymeleaf templates -->
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-webflux</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
	<groupId>com.c4-soft.springaddons</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-addons-starter-oidc</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
And
```yaml
auth0-issuer: http://localhost:8442/realms/master
auth0-client-id: change-me
auth0-secret: change-me

spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          auth0:
            issuer-uri: ${auth0-issuer}
        registration:
          auth0-authorization-code:
            authorization-grant-type: authorization_code
            client-id: ${auth0-client-id}
            client-secret: ${auth0-secret}
            provider: auth0
            scope: openid,profile,email,offline_access
com:
  c4-soft:
    springaddons:
      oidc:
        ops:
        - iss: ${auth0-issuer}
          username-claim: $['https://c4-soft.com/user']['name']
          authorities:
          - path: $['https://c4-soft.com/user']['roles']
          - path: $.permissions
        client:
          security-matchers:
          - /login/**
          - /oauth2/**
          - /logout
          - /
          - /ui/**
          permit-all:
          - /login/**
          - /oauth2/**
          - /
          # Auth0 and Cognito do not follow strictly the OpenID RP-Initiated Logout spec and need specific configuration
          oauth2-logout:
            auth0-authorization-code:
              uri: ${auth0-issuer}v2/logout
              client-id-request-param: client_id
              post-logout-uri-request-param: returnTo
          # Auth0 requires an "audience" parameter in authorization-code request to deliver JWTs
          authorization-request-params:
            auth0-authorization-code:
            - name: audience
              value: demo.c4-soft.com
        resourceserver:
          permit-all:
          - "/greet/public"
```
With the above configuration, two distinct security filter-chains will be defined:
- a client one with sessions (and CSRF protection enabled), intercepting all requests to UI templates as well as those involved in login and logout, and redirecting to login unauthorized requests to protected templates.
- a resource server one acting as default (with lowest precedence to process all requests that were not matched with client filter-chain `securityMatchers`), without sessions (requests are secured with JWT access tokens) nor CSRF protections, and returning 401 to unauthorized requests to protected resources.

### 1.2. Customizing Auto-Configuration
First use your IDE auto-completion to check if there isn't an existing application property covering your needs: a lot is configurable from properties, and all properties are documented.

You can override about any `@Bean` defined by spring-addons (almost all are `@ConditionalOnMissingBean`). Here are a few handy ones:
- `(Reactive)JwtAbstractAuthenticationTokenConverter`: take control on the `Authentication` instance built after a JWT was successfully decoded and validated
- `(Reactive)OpaqueTokenAuthenticationConverter`: take control on the `Authentication` instance built after an access token was successfully introspected
- `ClaimSetAuthoritiesConverter`: opt-out the `ConfigurableClaimSetAuthoritiesConverter`, responsible for authorities mapping
- `GrantedAuthoritiesMapper`: in OAuth2 clients, opt-out the default `GrantedAuthoritiesMapper` (which delegates authorities mapping to the `ConfigurableClaimSetAuthoritiesConverter` just above)
- `(Reactive)AuthenticationManagerResolver`: opt-out the authentication manager implementing static multi-tenancy for resource servers with JWT decoders
- `ResourceServerAuthorizeExchangeSpecPostProcessor`, `ClientAuthorizeExchangeSpecPostProcessor`, `ClientAuthorizeExchangeSpecPostProcessor` or `ResourceServerAuthorizeExchangeSpecPostProcessor`: fine grained access control from configuration (an alternative is using `@Enable(Reactive)MethodSecurity` and `@PreAuthorize` on controller methods)
- `ResourceServerHttpSecurityPostProcessor` or `ClientHttpSecurityPostProcessor`: post-process spring-addons auto-configured `SecurityFilterChains` (this enables to change absolutely anything from it).

### 1.3. Disabling `spring-addons-oidc-starter`
The easiest way is to exclude it from the classpath, but you may also turn the auto-configuration off by:
- setting `com.c4-soft.springaddons.oidc.resourceserver.enabled` to `false` (this disables the resource server `SecurityFilterChain` bean instantiation, as well as all of its default dependencies)
- leaving `com.c4-soft.springaddons.oidc.client.securityMatcher` empty (this disables the client `SecurityFilterChain` bean instantiation, as well as all of its default dependencies)

## 2. <a name="unit-tests"/>Unit & Integration Testing With Security
Testing method security (`@PreAuthorize`, `@PostFilter`, etc.) requires to configure the security context. `Spring-security-test` provides with `MockMvc` request post-processors and `WebTestClient` mutators to do so, but this requires the context of a request, which limits its usage to testing secured controllers.

To test method security on any type of `@Component` (`@Controller`, off course, but also `@Service` and `@Repository`) there are  only two options: build tests security context by yourself and populate it with stubbed / mocked authentications, or use annotations to do it for you. **This lib conatins annotations to configure test security context with OAuth2 authentication at your hand.**

An [article covering the usage of OAuth2 test annotations from this lib](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-oauth-testing-access-control) was published on Baeldung. This, along with all [samples](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/samples) and [tutorials](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/samples/tutorials) source-code (which contain a lot of unit and integration testing), should be enough to get you started.

However, since this article was published, test annotations have improved.

### 2.1. Sample
Let's consider the following secured `@Service`
```java
@Service
public class SecuredService {
    @PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('NICE')")
    String nice() {
        return "Dear %s, glad to see you!".formatted(SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getName());
    }
    
    @PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated()")
    String hello() {
        return "Hello %s.".formatted(SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getName());
    }
}
```
Now, let's assume that you have a staging environment with a few representative users ("personas" if you are familiar with UX), for which you can get sample access tokens, and dump the claims in JSON files in test resources in (by decoding JWTs with a tool like https://jwt.io or introspecting opaque tokens). In the following, we'll consider you have a user named `brice` with `NICE` authority and another one named `igor` without the `NICE` authority. We'll also consider you have dumped sample claim-sets in `brice.json` and `igor.json`.

#### 2.1.1. Using `@WithMockAuthentication`
When testing RBAC (role-based access control), defining just authorities is frequently enough. Sometimes, defining the `Authentication#name` is necessary and in a few cases, application code needs a specific `Authentication` implementation. `@WithMockAuthentication` was designed to meet this requirements:
```java
@SpringBootTest(classes = { SecurityConfig.class, MessageService.class })
class MessageServiceTests {

	@Autowired
	private SecuredService securedService;
	
	@Test
	@WithMockAuthentication("BAD_BOY")
	void givenUserIsNotGrantedWithNice_whenCallNice_thenThrows() {
		assertThrows(Exception.class, () -> securedService.nice());
	}

	@Test
	@WithMockAuthentication(name = "brice", authorities = "NICE")
	void givenUserIsNice_whenCallNice_thenReturnsGreeting() {
		assertThat(securedService.nice()).isEqualTo("Dear brice, glad to see you!");
	}

	@ParameterizedTest
	@AuthenticationSource(
	    @WithMockAuthentication(name = "brice", authorities = "NICE"),
	    @WithMockAuthentication(name = "ch4mp", authorities = { "VERY_NICE", "AUTHOR" }))
	void givenUserIsAuthenticated_whenCallHello_thenReturnsGreeting(@ParameterizedAuthentication Authentication auth) {
		assertThat(securedService.hello()).isEqualTo("Hello %s.".formatted(auth.getName()));
	}
}
```

#### 2.1.1. Using `@WithJwt` or `@WithOpaqueToken` with JSON claim-sets
`@WithJwt` and `@WithOpaqueToken` enable to load those claim-sets and turn it into `Authentication` instances using the authentication converter from your security configuration, and as so, with the same type, authorities, name and claims as at runtime.
```java
@AddonsWebmvcComponentTest // omit if you're not using the starter, this loads a minimal subset of spring-addons security conf
@SpringBootTest(classes = { SecurityConfig.class, MessageService.class })
class MessageServiceTests {

	@Autowired
	private SecuredService securedService;

	@Autowired
	WithJwt.AuthenticationFactory authFactory;
	
	@Test
	@WithJwt("igor.json")
	void givenUserIsIgor_whenCallNice_thenThrows() {
		assertThrows(Exception.class, () -> securedService.nice());
	}

	@Test
	@WithJwt("brice.json")
	void givenUserIsBrice_whenCallNice_thenReturnsGreeting() {
		assertThat(securedService.nice()).isEqualTo("Dear brice, glad to see you!");
	}

	@ParameterizedTest
	@MethodSource("identities")
	void givenUserIsAuthenticated_whenCallHello_thenReturnsGreeting(@ParameterizedAuthentication Authentication auth) {
		assertThat(securedService.hello()).isEqualTo("Hello %s.".formatted(auth.getName()));
	}

	Stream<AbstractAuthenticationToken> identities() {
		return authFactory.authenticationsFrom("brice.json", "igor.json");
	}
}
```
There are we few things worth noting above:
- we are testing a `@Service` having methods decorated with `@PreAuthorize`, without `MockMvc` or `WebTestClient` (and their request post-processors or mutators)
- authorities and username will be coherent with claims during tests (it is not necessarily the case when we declare the 3 separately as done with MockMvc request post-processors and WebTestClient mutators). `WithJwt.AuthenticationFactory` uses the JWT authorities converter found in security configuration. As a consequence, `username` and `authorities` are resolved from claims, just as it is at runtime.
- the claims are loaded from a JSON files in the test classpath
- we are using JUnit 5 `@ParameterizedTest`: the test will run once for each of the authentication in the stream provided  by the `identities` method
- annotations fit so well with BDD (given-when-then): the test pre-conditions (given) are decorating the test instead of cluttering its content like MockMvc request post-processors and WebTestClient mutators do
- annotations can be very brief and expressive

### 2.2. Which Dependency / Annotation to Use
`spring-addons-oauth2-test` is enough to use test annotations, but if you opted for `spring-addons-starter-oidc`, then `spring-addons-starter-oidc-test` is better suited as it comes with tooling to load spring-addons auto-configuration during tests (refer to the many samples for usage).

`@WithMockAuthentication` should be enough to test applications with RBAC (role-based access control): it allows to easily define `name` and `authorities`, as well as the Authentication an principal types to mock if your application code expects something specific.

In case your access-control uses more than just name and authorities, you'll probably need to define claim-set details. In this case, `@WithJwt` and `@WithOpaqueToken` can come pretty handy as it uses respectively the JWT or OpaqueToken authentication converter in your security configuration to build the authentication instance, using a JSON payload from the classpath (or a plain Java String): you might just dump payloads of access tokens for representative users in test resources (use a tool like https://jwt.io to easily get those payloads).
This starters are designed to push auto-configuration one step further. In most cases, you should need 0 Java conf. An effort was made to make [tutorials](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/samples/tutorials), Javadoc and modules READMEs as informative as possible. Please refer there for more details. Additionally refer to [module, dependency, class and other diagrams](https://sourcespy.com/github/ch4mpyspringaddons/) for a general overview of the repository.

## 3. <a name="start"/>Where to Start
[Tutorials](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/samples/tutorials) which cover:
- just enough OAuth2 theory
- dev environment configuration (SSL certificate, Keycloak)
- various resource-servers security configuration scenarios
- security rules unit-testing

[Samples](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/samples) cover:
- `@Controller`, `@Service` and `@Repository` **unit testing**
- **integration testing** (`@SpringBootTest`) with mocked authentication
- all combinations with choices from the following 3 points:
  * webmvc / webflux
  * JWT decoder / access token introspection
  * `OAuthentication<OpenidClaimSet>` / Spring default `Authentication` implementation (`JwtAuthenticationToken` for JWT decoder or `BearerTokenAuthentication` for token introspection)

## 4. <a name="versions"/>Versions & Requirements
6.x and 7.X branch are designed for spring-boot 3 and requires JDK 17 as minimum.

- create `@WithJwt` to build OAuth2 `Authentication` during tests, using a JSON string or file on the classpath and submitting it to the JWT authentication converter. All samples and tutorials are updated with this new annotation.
- deprecate `@WithMockJwt` and `@OpenId` (use the new `@WithJwt` instead)
- remove the archetypes

#### `6.1.16`
- [gh-133](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/issues/133) Add a property to auto configure an `audience` JWT validator (if present, the `aud` claim in the token will be checked to contain the URI provided in the conf)

#### `6.1.15`
- [gh-129](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/issues/129) Auto-configure (with application properties) additional parameters for authorization-code request. This allows, for instance, to send an `audience` as required by Auth0. Additional parameters are defined for each client registration. In the following sample, `client-registration` `a` and `b` references an existing entries in spring.security.oauth2.client.registration:
```yaml
com:
  c4-soft:
    springaddons:
      security:
        client:
          authorization-request-params:
            client-registration-a:
            - name: audience
              value: demo.c4-soft.com
            client-registration-b:
            - name: machin
              value: truc
            - name: machin
              value: chose
```

#### `6.1.14`
- [gh-128](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/issues/128) add `@ClasspathClaims` to load claims from a JSON file in the classpath (test resources for instance).
```java
@Test
@WithMockJwtAuth(
  authorities = "ROLE_AUTHORIZED_PERSONNEL",
  claims = @OpenIdClaims(
    usernameClaim = "$['https://c4-soft.com/user']['name']",
    jsonFile = @ClasspathClaims("ch4mp.json")))
void givenUserIsAuthenticatedWithJsonClaims_whenGetClaims_thenOk() throws Exception {
  api.get("/greet").andExpect(status().isOk()).andExpect(content().string("Hello Ch4mp! You are granted with [ROLE_AUTHORIZED_PERSONNEL]."));
}
```
- [gh-127](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/issues/127) add a `json` property to @OpenIdClaims to define all calims with a JSON string
```java
@WithMockJwtAuth(
authorities = { "ROLE_AUTHORIZED_PERSONNEL" },
claims = @OpenIdClaims(
  usernameClaim = "$['https://c4-soft.com/user']['name']",
  json = """
{
  "https://c4-soft.com/user": {
    "name": "Ch4mp",
    "email": "ch4mp@c4-soft.com"
  },
  "aud": "https://localhost:7082"
}"""))
```

#### `6.1.13`
- [gh-125](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/issues/125) Split claims used as `GrantedAuthority` source on comma and space (for instance, `scope` claim is usually a single string with comma separated scopes).

#### `6.1.12`
- [gh-122](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/issues/122) Support for parametrized OAuth2 Authentications in `@ParameterizedTest`. In the following sample, **mind the `@JwtAuthenticationSource`** (decoring test) **and `@ParameterizedJwtAuth`** (decoring test method parameter). The first annotation defines the different authentication instances, the second inserts the one for the current test in the security context and provides it as test method parameter:
```java
@ParameterizedTest
@JwtAuthenticationSource({ @WithMockJwtAuth("NICE"), @WithMockJwtAuth("VERY_NICE") })
void givenUserIsGrantedWithAnyNiceAuthority_whenGetRestricted_thenOk(@ParameterizedJwtAuth JwtAuthenticationToken auth) throws Exception {
	api.perform(get("/restricted"))
			.andExpect(status().isOk())
			.andExpect(jsonPath("$.body").value("You are so nice!"));
}
```
  The above will run two distinct tests in  sequence, one with each of the provided `@WithMockJwtAuth`. Same for:
  * `@WithMockBearerTokenAuthentication` with `@BearerAuthenticationSource` and `@ParameterizedBearerAuth`
  * `@OpenId` with `@OpenIdAuthenticationSource` and `@ParameterizedOpenId`
  * `@WithOAuth2Login` with `@OAuth2LoginAuthenticationSource` and `@ParameterizedOAuth2Login`
  * `@WithOidcLogin` with `@OidcLoginAuthenticationSource` and `@ParameterizedOidcLogin`

#### `6.1.11`
- Spring Boot 3.1.0

#### `6.1.10`
- Spring Boot 3.0.7

#### `6.1.9`
- [gh-112](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/issues/112) fix CSRF token exposed to Javascript in servlets applications. Thanks to @giovannicandido for spotting and fixing this.

#### `6.1.8`
- Spring Boot 3.0.6

#### `6.1.7`
- create `ServletConfigurationSupport` and `ReactiveConfigurationSupport` in `spring-addons-{webmvc|webflux}-core` to remove code duplication from starters

#### `6.1.5`
- add new helpers to type private claims in test annotations for `Double`, `URIs`, `URLs` and `Date`
- add 1 level of nested claims to `@Claims`, the test annotation to define private claims in OAuth2 test annotations. It is not possible to describe recursive structures with annotation (annotation with a node of the same type as itself), which is an issue to describe a JSON document. To configure further nested claims, it is still possible to use `@JsonObjectClaim` with serialized JSON strings. Sample usage with all possible types of claims (hopefully, it will never be necessary to configure as many claims in a single test):
```java
@WithMockJwtAuth(authorities = "ROLE_AUTHORIZED_PERSONNEL", claims = @OpenIdClaims(sub = "Ch4mpy", otherClaims = @Claims(
        intClaims = { @IntClaim(name = "int1", value = 42), @IntClaim(name = "int2", value = 51) },
        longClaims = { @LongClaim(name = "long1", value = 42), @LongClaim(name = "long2", value = 51) },
        doubleClaims = { @DoubleClaim(name = "double1", value = 4.2), @DoubleClaim(name = "double2", value = 5.1) },
        stringClaims = { @StringClaim(name = "str1", value = "String 1"), @StringClaim(name = "str2", value = "String 2") },

        urlClaims = { @StringClaim(name = "url1", value = "https://localhost:8080/greet"), @StringClaim(name = "url2", value = "https://localhost:4200/home") },
        epochSecondClaims = { @IntClaim(name = "epoch1", value = 1670978400), @IntClaim(name = "epoch2", value = 1680648172)},
        dateClaims = { @StringClaim(name = "date1", value = "2022-12-14T00:40:00.000+00:00"), @StringClaim(name = "date1", value = "2023-04-04T00:42:00.000+00:00") },
        stringArrayClaims = { @StringArrayClaim(name = "strArr1", value = { "a", "b", "c" }), @StringArrayClaim(name = "strArr2", value = { "D", "E", "F" }) },
        jsonObjectClaims = { @JsonObjectClaim(name = "obj1", value = obj1), @JsonObjectClaim(name = "obj2", value = obj2)},
        jsonObjectArrayClaims = @JsonObjectArrayClaim(name = "objArr1", value = { obj3, obj4}),
        nestedClaims = { @NestedClaims(
                name = "https://c4-soft.com/user",
                intClaims = { @IntClaim(name = "nested_int1", value = 42), @IntClaim(name = "nested_int2", value = 51) },
                longClaims = { @LongClaim(name = "nested_long1", value = 42), @LongClaim(name = "nested_long2", value = 51) },
                doubleClaims = { @DoubleClaim(name = "nested_double1", value = 4.2), @DoubleClaim(name = "nested_double2", value = 5.1) },
                stringClaims = { @StringClaim(name = "nested_str1", value = "String 1"), @StringClaim(name = "nested_str2", value = "String 2") },
                uriClaims = { @StringClaim(name = "nested_uri1", value = "https://localhost:8080/greet"), @StringClaim(name = "nested_uri2", value = "https://localhost:4200/home#greet") },
                urlClaims = { @StringClaim(name = "nested_url1", value = "https://localhost:8080/greet"), @StringClaim(name = "nested_url2", value = "https://localhost:4200/home") },
                epochSecondClaims = { @IntClaim(name = "nested_epoch1", value = 1670978400), @IntClaim(name = "nested_epoch2", value = 1680648172)},
                dateClaims = { @StringClaim(name = "nested_date1", value = "2022-12-14T00:40:00.000+00:00"), @StringClaim(name = "nested_date1", value = "2023-04-04T00:42:00.000+00:00") },
                stringArrayClaims = { @StringArrayClaim(name = "nested_strArr1", value = { "a", "b", "c" }), @StringArrayClaim(name = "nested_strArr2", value = { "D", "E", "F" }) },
                jsonObjectClaims = { @JsonObjectClaim(name = "nested_obj1", value = obj1), @JsonObjectClaim(name = "nested_obj2", value = obj2)},
                jsonObjectArrayClaims = @JsonObjectArrayClaim(name = "nested_objArr1", value = { obj3, obj4}))})))
```

#### `6.1.4`
- gh-106: Properties to disable spring-addons security filter-chain auto-configuration:
  * for clients: empty path-matchers array or `com.c4-soft.springaddons.security.client.enabled=false`
  * for resource servers: `com.c4-soft.springaddons.security.enabled=false`

#### `6.1.3`
- fix CSRF protection configuration (apply https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/5.8/migration/servlet/exploits.html#_i_am_using_a_single_page_application_with_cookiecsrftokenrepository and https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/5.8/migration/reactive.html#_i_am_using_angularjs_or_another_javascript_framework)
- rework the Javadoc and README of all 6 OAuth2 starters
- introduce a Back-Channel Logout client implementation to both client starters
- rework BFF and resource server & client tutorials with spring-addons client starters

#### `6.1.2`
- boot 3.0.4
- add a BFF tutorial

#### `6.1.1`
- add [spring-addons-webmvc-client](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/webmvc/spring-addons-webmvc-client)
- add [spring-addons-webflux-client](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/webflux/spring-addons-webflux-client)
- in both client starters, add a logout handler for OP with RP-Initiated logout implementations which do not comply with OIDC standard. This handler is configurable from properties (logout end-point and post-logout URIs). See [`resource-server_with_ui` tutorial](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/samples/tutorials/resource-server_with_ui) for details.

#### `6.1.0`
- **breaking change in properties:** authorities mapping is now configured per claim JSON path (instead of per issuer). This enables to use different prefix (and case) for different claims (for instance `SCOPE_` for `scope` claim and `ROLE_` for `realm_access.roles` one). As a consequence, `com.c4-soft.springaddons.security.issuers[].authorities.claims[]` is replaced with `com.c4-soft.springaddons.security.issuers[].authorities[].path`.Also, `prefix` as well as `case` are put at the same level as (JSON) `path`.

Sample migration with YAML:
```yml
com:
  c4-soft:
    springaddons:
      security:
        issuers:
        - location: ${keycloak-issuer}
          username-claim: preferred_username
          authorities:
            prefix: ROLE_
            claims:
            - realm_access.roles
            - resource_access.client1.roles
```
Becomes:
```yml
com:
  c4-soft:
    springaddons:
      security:
        issuers:
        - location: ${keycloak-issuer}
          username-claim: $.preferred_username
          authorities:
          - path: $.realm_access.roles
            prefix: ROLE_
          - path: $.resource_access.client1.roles
            prefix: ROLE_
```
- "pseudo" JSON path for username and authorities claims is now actual JSON path. This means that `$.resource_access.*.roles` will be successfully accepted. Thanks to JSON path syntax, this is not a breaking change (`$.resource_access.client1.roles` and `resource_access.client1.roles` are interpreted the same)
- bump to Spring Boot 3.0.3

#### `6.0.16`
- Add a `username-clame` configuration property to define, per issuer, from which claim of the access token should be retrieved the username (what is returned by `Authentication::getName`). Default is subject for backward compatibility

#### `6.0.15`
- [gh-100](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/issues/100) prevent a NPE in reactive resource-server using JWT spring-addons starter when the issuer in an access token is not listed in conf. All credits go to [lArtiquel](https://github.com/lArtiquel) who spotted the bug and submitted the fix.

#### `6.0.13`
- create `ServerHttpRequestSupport` and `HttpServletRequestSupport` to help statically access to the request in current context (usage in authentication converters for instance

#### `6.0.12`
- add `@WithOAuth2Login` and `@WithOidcLogin` to populate test security-context with an `OAuth2AuthenticationToken` instance (with respectively `DefaultOAuth2User` and `DefaultOidcUser` as principal)
- bump to spring-boot `3.0.2`
- default authorities collection in tests annotations, `MockMvc` post-processors and `WebTestClient` mutators is set to empty array (instead of `{ "ROLE_USER" }`)

#### `6.0.11`
- [gh-86](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/issues/86) `OAuthentication::setDetails` [should not throw](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/11822) until spring-security 6.1 is released
- [gh-87](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/issues/87) spring-addons JWT starters should start even if `spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri` is set in configuration properties

#### `6.0.10`
- [gh-83](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/issues/83) do not force traffic to http when SSL is not enabled (just force https when SSL is enabled)

#### `6.0.9`
- Make OAuthentication immutable

#### `6.0.7`
- release with spring-boot 3.0.0 GA as transitive dependency

#### `6.0.1`
- [samples](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/samples) for all combinations of:
  * webmvc / webflux
  * JWT decoder / access token introspection
  * `OAuthentication<OpenidClaimSet>` / Spring default `Authentication` implementation (`JwtAuthenticationToken` for JWT decoder or `BearerTokenAuthentication` for token introspection)
- minor fixes (@WithMockAuthentication and reactive + introspection starter)

#### `6.0.0`
- Switch to spring-boot 3 (and spring-security 6)
- Stop supporting the [very deprecated Keycloak libs for spring](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/discussions/10187)

### 5.3. `5.x` branch
This branch is not maintained anymore. Only versions compatible with Spring 6.1.x (Boot 3.1.x) and JDK >= 17 are maintained.

#### `5.4.2`
- [gh-100](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/issues/100) prevent a NPE in reactive resource-server using JWT spring-addons starter when the issuer in an access token is not listed in conf. All credits go to [lArtiquel](https://github.com/lArtiquel) who spotted the bug and submitted the fix.

#### `5.4.0`
- Use a single bean name for
  * `ServletSecurityBeans` and `ReactiveSecurityBeans`: AddonsSecurityBeans
  * `@AutoConfigureAddonsSecurity{Webmvc|Weblux}{Jwt|Introspecting}`: `@AutoConfigureAddonsSecurity`
- Add `@AutoConfigureAddonsWebSecurity` to do the same as existing `@AutoConfigureAddonsSecurity` which now loads authorities converter only (useful to unit-test @Components that are not @Controller).
- More options for CSRF configuration (enum property instead of a boolean) and CSRF disabled by default when session-management is state-less.
- Compatibility with JDK 1.8 and spring-boot 2.6 (get version 6.x for spring-boot 3 and JDK 17)
- webflux dependencies cleanup (were pulling some servlet dependencies)
- All samples now demo @Service and @Repository unit-tests in addition to @Controller ones.

#### `5.3.0`
Use `JwtAuthenticationToken` or `BearerAuthenticationToken` by default in  resource-server starters. For some reason, `OAuthentication<OpenidClaimSet>` frightens rookies.
- make `OAuth2AuthenticationFactory` `@Bean` optional.
- remove `OAuth2ClaimsConverter` (interface definition and @ConditionalOnMissingBean)
- remove the recently added `oauth2-authentication-factory-enabled` property (instead, evaluate if an `OAuth2AuthenticationFactory` bean was provided)

#### `5.2.2`
- resource-server starter main beans (`Security(Web)FilterChain`) are no-longer "conditional on missing": if you dan't want it, don't pull starter lib.
- add `oauth2-authentication-factory-enabled` flag to easily fall-back to Spring default OAuth2 `Authentication` implementations (`JwtAuthenticationToken` and `BearerTokenAuthentication` for resource-servers with respectively JWT decoder or opaque token introspection)

#### `5.1.3`
- keycloak 19
- release with JDK 17 and boot 2.7.2
- release with JDK 1.8 and boot 2.6.10

#### `5.1.0`
- Support token introspection for resource-servers.
- Rename `spring-addons-*-jwt-resource-server-test` to `spring-addons-*-test` as it apply for both JWT and introspection

#### `5.0.0`
Rename modules to:
- have all module names start with `spring-addons` prefix, then intermediate module if any (`archetypes`, `samples`, `starters`, `webmvc` or `webflux`) and last what leaf module aims at
- better reflect what it do

For instance, `spring-security-oauth2-webmvc-addons` only applies to resource-servers secured with JWTs (not to opaque tokens) -> renamed to `spring-addons-webmvc-jwt-resource-server`

Rename `com.c4-soft.springaddons.security.token-issuers` configuration properties to `com.c4-soft.springaddons.security.issuers` for the same reason: only accepts JWT token issuers (and not opaque token issuers with introspection end-point for instance)

#### `4.5.0`
CSRF enabled by default, using `CookieCsrfTokenRepository` if session management is "stateless".

#### `4.4.4`
[gh-53 GenericMethodSecurityExpressionHandler should accept expression root suppliers for many authentication type](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/issues/53)

#### `4.4.2`
add [reCAPTCHA validation spring-boot starter](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-addons-starters-recaptcha)

#### `4.4.1`
rename `@WithMockOidcAuth` to shorter and more expressive `@OpenId`: it populates test security context with an OAuth2 `Àuthentication` containing an OpenID claim-set

#### `4.4.0`
- rename `OpenidClaimSet` to `OpenidClaimSet`: more expressive as this class contains OpenID token claims only
- rename `OAuthentication` to `OAuthentication`: it has no more adherence to OpenID (just specific to authentication with encoded claims in a bearer string)

#### `4.3.2`
Slight properties rework. Now, to configure issuers and authorities mapping:
```
# should be set to where your authorization-server is
com.c4-soft.springaddons.security.issuers[0].location=https://localhost:8443/realms/master

# should be configured with a list of private-claims this authorization-server puts user roles into
# below is default Keycloak conf for a `spring-addons` client with client roles mapper enabled
com.c4-soft.springaddons.security.issuers[0].authorities.claims=realm_access.roles,resource_access.spring-addons-public.roles,resource_access.spring-addons-confidential.roles

# use IDE auto-completion or see SpringAddonsSecurityProperties javadoc for complete configuration properties list
```
where `caze` is one of `unchanged`, `upper` or `lower`

#### `4.3.0`
- [gh-50](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/issues/50): One entry per authorization-server for authorities mapping (see samples `application.properties` files for new configuration structure).
- [gh-51](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/issues/51): Group archetypes, webmvc and webflux modules.

#### `4.2.1`
- [gh-49](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/issues/49): Samples in dedicated modules. All samples are moved from libs tests to [`samples`](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/samples) module, with one sub-module per sample.

#### `4.2.0`
Cleanup and prepare for spring-boot 3:
- [gh-46](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/issues/46): split webmvc & webflux content from `spring-addons-oauth2` 
- [gh-47](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/issues/47): provide `SecurityFilterChain` bean instead of extending `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`
- [gh-48](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/issues/48): make use of spring-boot `@AutoConfiguration`

#### `4.1.5`
- Replace multiple JWT issuers JwtDecoder (from 4.1.4) with `AuthenticationManagerResolver` @Beans 

#### `4.1.4`
- JwtDecoder for configuring multiple JWT issuers (single resource server accepting IDs from two or more authorization-servers)

#### `4.1.3`
- finer configuration control with `SpringAddonsSecurityProperties`

#### `4.0.0`
- move keycloak related code to `spring-addons-keycloak`

#### `3.2.0`
- Master branch back to single JDK: 17
- Create `jdk1.8` and `jdk11` branches

#### `3.1.16`
- Add [spring-addons-archetypes-webmvc-multimodule](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/blob/master/spring-addons-archetypes-webmvc-multimodule) to boostrap native-ready Spring REST API with webmvc, JPA, OpenAPI and OpenID security.

#### `3.1.13`
- Add a [sample](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/blob/master/custom-oidc-authentication-impl.MD) with `OpenidClaimSet` specialisation (parse private claims in addition to authorities).

#### `3.1.12`
- Improve `OidcReactiveApiSecurityConfig` and `OidcServletApiSecurityConfig` usability: ease security beans replacement (including authorities and authentication converter for use cases where OAuthentication is not enough)

#### `3.1.11`
- Rename `SecurityProperties` to less conflicting `SpringAddonsSecurityProperties`

#### `3.1.10`
- Turn `AbstractOidc...ApiSecurityConfig` into `Oidc...ApiSecurityConfig` with default authorities mapper being keycloak or Auth0 depending on `com.c4-soft.springaddons.security.keycloak.client-id` being set or not
- More CORS and authorities mapping configuration in `SecurityProperties`

#### `3.1.8`
- Fix missing JTI claim mapping from `@OpenIdClaims` ([gh-35](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/issues/35)).

#### `3.1.7`
- Add `AbstractOidcReactiveApiSecurityConfig` to `spring-addons-oauth2`. It provides with reasonable default WebSecurityConfig for a reactive (weblux) based API secured with OAuthentication.

#### `3.1.6`
- Add `AbstractOidcServletApiSecurityConfig` to `spring-addons-oauth2`. It provides with reasonable default WebSecurityConfig for a servlet based API secured with OAuthentication.

#### `3.1.4`
- lombok with provided scope ([gh-31](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/issues/31))

#### `3.1.3`
- spring-boot 2.6.1
- release with JDK version (compilation and runtime target)

#### `3.1.0`
- spring-boot 2.6

#### `3.0.0`
- in OAuth2 related test annotations all claims are now grouped under a single `claims = @OpenIdClaims(...)`
- `@WithMockJwtAuth` in addition to `@WithMockKeycloakAuth` and `@WithMockOidcAuth`
- some code cleanup, quite a bunch of code removed and some renaming (including breaking changes, reason for new major version)

#### `2.6.6`
- import spring-boot 2.5.5 BOM (instead of inheriting 2.5.4 POM)

#### `2.6.5`
- Downgrade Java compatibility to 1.8

#### `2.6.1`
- spring-boot 2.5.4

#### `2.6.0`
- replace `KeycloakOidcIdAuthenticationConverter` with `SynchronizedJwt2OidcIdAuthenticationConverter` and complement it with `ReactiveJwt2OidcIdAuthenticationConverter`
- remove references to Keycloak from `spring-addons-oauth2` (implementations where mostly useless)

#### `2.5.4`
- bump Keycloak BOM to 14.0.0

#### `2.5.3`
- bump spring-boot to 2.5

#### `2.5.1`
- introduce `@JsonObjectClaim` and `@JsonArrayClaim` to configure complex private claims. Sample: `@WithMockKeycloakAuth(otherClaims = @ClaimSet(jsonObjectClaims = @JsonObjectClaim(name = "foo", value = "{\"bar\":\"bad\", \"nested\":{\"deep\":\"her\"}, \"arr\":[1,2,3]}")))` or `@WithMockOidcId(privateClaims = @JsonObjectClaim(name = "foo", value = "{\"bar\":\"bad\", \"nested\":{\"deep\":\"her\"}, \"arr\":[1,2,3]}"))`

#### `2.4.1`
- [issue #14](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/issues/14) added jti and nbf (from JWT spec) to @IdTokenClaims (an ID token is a JWT)
- [issue #14](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/issues/14) added session_state to @IdTokenClaims as per https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html#CreatingUpdatingSessions
- [issue #14](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/issues/14) rename `privateClaims` to `otherClaims` in `@WithMockKeycloakAuth`
- [issue #15](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/issues/15) `GrantedAuthoritiesMapper` is now optional in test config. Defaulted to `NullAuthoritiesMapper`

#### `2.4.0`
- rename `ServletKeycloakAuthUnitTestingSupport::keycloakAuthenticationToken()` to `authentication()` to improve API fluidity (`api.with(keycloak.authentication()).get(...)`)

#### `2.3.0`
- implementation closer to [open ID specs](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html): split claims into `@IdTokenClaims` and `@OidcStandardClaims`
- re-use OIDC ID annotations into `@WithMockKeycloakAuth`

#### `2.2.0`
- `OidcId::getName()` returns `subject` claim instead of `preferred_username`
- replace `name` with `subject` in `@WithMockOidcId`
- replace `name` from `@WithMockKeycloakAuth` with `preferedUsername` in `@WithAccessToken`
- support for private claims in `@WithMockOidcId` and `@WithMockKeycloakAuth` (claims with values of type `int`, `long`, `String` and `String[]` only)
- add missing subject claim in Keycloak access and ID tokens
- compose `@WithAccessToken` with `@WithKeycloakIDToken` instead of repeting properties (`AccessToken` extends `IDToken`)
- add advanced `@WithMockKeycloakAuth` sample usage in [`spring-addons-oauth2-test` README](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-addons-oauth2-test)

#### `2.1.0`
- fix Keycloak typo (was wrongly spelled Keycloack at many places)
- add samples with authrities retieved from a DB instead of the JWT for both OAuthentication and JwtAuthenticationToken
- add sample involving `keycloak-spring-boot-starter` and `keycloak-spring-security-adapter`

#### `2.0.0`
This release is still focused on unit-testing Spring OAuth2 applications

- `@WithMockAuthentication` annotation along with `mockAuthentication()` servlet (webmvc) and reactive (webflux) flow APIs. You choose the `Authentication` type, the framework feeds the security context with a Mockito mock. This is dead simple but should cover 99% of test cases. I wonder why I didn't think of it sooner...
- Focus solely on adding to Spring `Authentication` implementations and tests tooling (no more alternatives, with an exception for `OidcId` which overlaps Spring's `OidcIdToken`)
- Split `webmvc` (servlets) and `webflux` (reactive) code in distinct libs to ease dependency management
- Re-shuffle packages and jars (less code, less jars, more expressive package names)
- WIP: Extensives samples and tests. Samples are boot apps under `src/test` to keep jars small
- Use Keycloak as authorisation-server for all resource-server samples, each of which configuring a specific `Authentication` impl

Note that I chose Keycloak because it's a feature rich, easy to setup authorisation-server.
It should not be much of an effort to migrate sample resource-servers to another one, with an exception of those using `KeycloakAuthenticationToken` as authentication impl, of course.
