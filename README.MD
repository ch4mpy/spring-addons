# Ease OAuth2 / OpenID Configuration & Tests in Spring Boot 3 

## Breaking News

`7.9.0-M3`, is out. It is designed to work with Spring Boot `3.4.0-M3`, Security `6.4.0-M4`, and Cloud `2024.0.0-M1`. It comes with two main features:
- Working [Back-Channel Logout](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html) for OAuth2 clients with `oauth2Login` (at last :/). If you don't know about Back-Channel Logout, it is some sort of *"single sign-out"* for systems with *Single Sign On* (SSO). Keycloak is a sample of an OpenID Provider capable of emitting Back-Channel Logout events to a Spring client (like a Gateway used as an OAuth2 BFF). This feature is disabled by default. The default internal logout URI and session cookie name can be overriden in properties:
```yaml
com:
  c4-soft:
    springaddons:
      oidc:
        client:
          back-channel-logout:
            enabled: true
            internal-logout-uri: ${gateway-uri}/logout/connect/back-channel/quiz-bff
            cookie-name: JSESSION-ID
```
- The status for unauthorized requests can now be configured in properties for client with `oauth2Login`. Default is still `302 Found` (redirect to login). But, we can now change it to `401 Unauthorized` on a Gateway facing single page or mobile applications with:
```yaml
com:
  c4-soft:
    springaddons:
      oidc:
        client:
          oauth2-redirections:
            authentication-entry-point: UNAUTHORIZED
```

## OIDC starters

### [`spring-addons-starter-oidc`](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-addons-starter-oidc)

Reduce Java Security conf to 0 in scenarios like:
- accepting tokens issued by several trusted authorization servers
- having per environment CORS configuration (not allowing the same origins in staging and prod for instance)
- mapping authorities from a variety of claims, with custom prefix and case
- customizing OAuth2 redirection URI or HTTP status
- exposing CSRF token as a cookie accessible to a single-page application
- logging out from an authorization server not strictly implementing RP-Initiated Logout (case of Auth0 and Amazon Cognito for instance)
- activating and configuring Back-Channel Logout in a Spring application with `oauth2Login`
- adding extra parameters to authorization or token requests (like the `audience` required by Auth0)

### [`spring-addons-starter-rest`](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-addons-starter-rest)

Configure declarative REST clients with `Bearer` or `Basic` authorization, and HTTP proxy settings with just properties. For OAuth2 authorization, a choice is made of using a new token using any Spring `registration`, or to re-use the access token in the security context of a resource server.

For instance, to get an implementation for the following `@HttpExchange` with OAuth2 authorization:
```java
@HttpExchange(accept = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
public interface KeycloakAdminApi {

    @GetExchange(url = "/{realm}/users/count")
    Long getTotalUsersCount(@PathVariable(name = "realm") String realm);
}
```
This can be enough (see [the README](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-addons-starter-rest) for a sample with a `registration` using `client_credentials`):
```java
@Bean
KeycloakAdminApi keycloakAdminApi(SpringAddonsRestClientSupport restSupport) {
    return restSupport.service("keycloak-admin-api", KeycloakAdminApi.class);
}
```
```yaml
keycloak-base-uri: https://localhost:8443/auth
issuer: ${keycloak-base-uri}/realms/master

com:
  c4-soft:
    springaddons:
      oidc:
        ops:
        - iss: ${issuer}
      rest:
        client:
          keycloak-admin-api:
            base-url: ${keycloak-base-uri}/admin/realms
            authorization:
              oauth2:
                forward-bearer: true
```

## Unit & Integration Testing With Security

Testing access control requires to configure the test security context.  For that, `spring-security-test` provides with `MockMvc` request post-processors and `WebTestClient` mutators, but this can work only in the context of a request, which limits its usage to controllers.

To test any type of `@Component` (`@Controller`, off course, but also `@Service` and `@Repository`) there are  only two options:
- build tests security context by yourself and populate it with stubbed / mocked authentications
- use annotations to do it for you (this is where [spring-addons-oauth2-test](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-addons-oauth2-test) jumps in)

Useful resources:
- [spring-addons-oauth2-test](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-addons-oauth2-test) contains tests annotations and its README documents usage
- [spring-addons-starter-oidc-test](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-addons-starter-oidc-test) if you use `spring-addons-starter-oidc`
